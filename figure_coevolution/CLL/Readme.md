## Samples

The Tapestri data for the CLL data related to mtDNA and somatic nuclear DNA co-evolution were acquired in the following way:

| Library name | Samples |
| ------------ | ------- |
| CLL1 | CLL6 post-HSCT |
| CLL2 | CLL5 post-HSCT |
| CLL3 | CLL4 post-HSCT + CLL5 pre-FCR |
| CLL4 | CLL6 pre-FCR + CLL4 pre-FCR |

For deconvolution I used a combination of maternal mtDNA variants and germline SNPs.
