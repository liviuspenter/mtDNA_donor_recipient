# Deconvolution of in-silico mixing experiment with CLL4 and CLL5

For historical reasons during the data analyses, the sample CLL4 is called CLL_relapse1_1 while the sample from CLL5 is called CLL_relapse3_1
in the scripts. 

## mtDNA-based deconvolution (mtscATAC-seq) 
To perform the mixing, download the raw data (CLL4_1 and CLL5_1) from NCBI Geo (GSE163579) and process with cellranger-atac.

The first step using ```01_processing.sh``` is to
